# Datasets-Models
Our Goal at Oasis is to help improve the mycology community. We believe that communittes are best served when ideas, information, and help is shared. Therefore we have committed to make tools available to everyone. We provide online tools for idenifying contamination in substraite (). But additionally we also provide the data and models for these tools here. You can also contribute to this project in many ways! If you have images of clean or contaminated substrate please submit them here (). You will be able to find your submission in a few days (as we will be going through them manually to avoid bad data). If you have other ideas about how to contribute or for tools you would like to use, please contact us (https://oasis-123.square.site/contact-us)
